  <h1>How I Created This Website with ChatGPT</h1>
  <p class="post-meta">April 22, 2025</p>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>This year, I built this academic portfolio site with the help of ChatGPT. I wanted something minimal, clean, and focused — just like the personal sites of researchers. Here&rsquo;s how I did it step by step.</p>
<p>First, I decided to use Hugo, a fast and flexible static site generator. I chose a minimalist base theme and made edits to customize it to my personal academic brand.</p>
<p>To get started, I set up my project using GitHub Desktop. This helped me manage the code and keep track of changes easily. I created a new repository named <code>bernardotdsousa.github.io</code>, which also serves as the GitHub Pages URL.</p>
<p>The homepage features a short bio, a centered circular portrait, and links to research and contact information. I carefully tweaked the spacing to keep the layout compact but still readable.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Publications&rdquo; page includes my academic work. I manually edited the layout template in <code>layouts/publications/list.html</code>, adding entries in reverse chronological order. Each entry links to a PDF hosted in the <code>static/files/</code> folder and optionally to a DOI or repository page.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Archive&rdquo; section was added to document the site&rsquo;s development. It’s a place to reflect on technical steps, choices, and changes made over time.</p>
<p>To enable dark/light mode, I included a small JavaScript snippet that stores the user&rsquo;s theme preference. This adds a modern touch to the minimalist interface.</p>
<p>The whole site was written in HTML and Markdown, using Hugo partials and templates where needed. I preview changes locally using <code>hugo server</code>, then push updates to GitHub to publish them online.</p>
<p>This site is now a central point for my academic identity, helping others quickly find my work, my CV, and how to contact me.</p>

<p>If you’d like to build a minimalist academic website like this one, here’s a prompt you can use to get started with the help of ChatGPT or your favorite assistant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I want to create a clean, minimalist academic website — with pages for publications, a CV, an archive, and dark/light mode. I want to use Hugo as the static site generator and host it for free on GitHub Pages. Please walk me through the setup step-by-step, including theme selection, folder structure, markdown content, and publishing workflow. I’d like to write everything in Markdown, keep the styling simple, and make the site easy to maintain.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also explore this article for a similar approach using GitHub Pages and Jekyll (no coding experience required):<br>

<p>Both Hugo and Jekyll are great options. The most important thing is that your site reflects your work — clearly and professionally.</p>
<p>Start small. Write in Markdown. Focus on making your content accessible. You’ll be surprised how far you can go.</p>
